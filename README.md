# paper-pusher

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Usage

## Release

Here's how we release paper pusher (assuming we ever do it again):

1. Edit project with the version you'd like to release (maybe just delete the
snapshot part). 1.5.1-SNAPSHOT becomes 1.5.1
2. Commit and push
3. Push to heroku remote
4. Edit project with the next version and snapshot: 1.5.2-SNAPSHOT
5. Commit and push
6. Edit this README correct the parts that are wrong
7. Commit and push
